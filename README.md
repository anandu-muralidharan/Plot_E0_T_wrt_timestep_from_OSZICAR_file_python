Final version!!!. You can input the OSZICAR from the GUI interface, this will create a temporary file.txt which contain the T and E0 data. The code then plots the graphs and then delte the temporary file after its use. Now you dont need to extract each of the E0 and T data using GREP commands., This code will do it
